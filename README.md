# Composer

Composer is a system for exploring rules in Western music. It uses
TouchOSC for interacting with the rules, core.logic for composing
melodies, Overtone for playing melodies and core.async for wiring the
system.

## Presentations

Composer has been presented at the following conferences:

- FARM 2014 Workshop at ICFP,
  Gothenburg. [Slides](http://functional-art.org/2014/ThomasGKristensen.pdf),
  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y12tGSrJjc4) and
  [paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2633646). The paper and talk
  is concerned with the foundation of automated musical composition, the
  system design aimed at reponsiveness and some of the problems
  associated with using logic programming for music composition.
- FP Days 2014, London. [Slides](Thomas Kristensen FPDays 2014.pdf),
  video to appear online mid 2015. The presentation is concerned with
  how a high degree of decoupling is achieved in Composer, and how this
  relates to more traditional concepts of decoupling.

There is also [an early video](http://vimeo.com/55677313) of some of the
work that lay the foundation of the Composer system.
